# Vadim Niedental - Emotive Systems Designer

Most developers ship code that works.  
I ship experiences that *feel right*.

In an age where AI scaffolds entire systems in seconds, the only thing left that truly matters is **how it feels to use**. That is where I operate, at the intersection of interaction, perception, and design.

## 👁️ Philosophy

> *“People don’t remember code.  
> They remember how your interface made them feel.”*

The software world is filled with lifeless buttons, awkward transitions, and UI that exists just to check a box.  
But real design?
It is intentional. It listens. It moves *with* the user.

I design emotional trust into digital systems with motion, rhythm, and feedback that speaks.

## 🛠️ What I Do

- **Perception-Driven UI/UX**  
  Interfaces designed to respond as if they care.

- **Motion & Interaction Design**  
  Transitions are not decorations; they are conversation.

- **Vibe-Prototyping**  
  I build fast with intuition and let code serve the feel.

- **Digital Empathy**  
  Systems that behave like good listeners: predictable, smooth, and satisfying.

## 🔬 Notable Work

### [`vadimniedental.me`](https://vadimniedental.me)  
> A portfolio built to *be felt*, not just seen.  
> Full-screen sections, motion-based navigation, tactile UI components.

### `ui-rhythm-lab`  
> A component suite that explores feedback, microinteraction, and input feel.  
> Because one good animation does more than 100 lines of perfect logic.

## 🎯 Why This Matters

> **Function is the floor.
> Feel is the ceiling.**

As AI eats traditional development, <ins>*feeling*</ins> is the last frontier.  
Buttons will always work. But how many invite interaction?

I do not build code.
I build experiences worth touching again.

## 🧠 Actively Deepening

- Interface physics & animation timing curves  
- Godot (C#) + Unity UI motion systems  
- Cross-platform perceptual design principles  
- UX behavior testing & human feedback loops

## 🤝 Let Us Build What Sticks

If you design with taste, build with feel, and believe software should move with emotion.
We are on the same page.

Explore my work.
Steal ideas.
Fork components.  
But always ask yourself:  
> “Does this *feel* good to use?”

**Because forgettable software is everywhere.  
But interfaces that feel alive?
These are *rare*.**
